### Happiness across the world over time

The World Happiness Report is a well-known source of cross-country data on self-reported life satisfaction, collected by the Gallup World Poll. The visualizations below present the ‚Äòhappiness scores‚Äô for each country.

The main life evaluation question asked in the poll is the Cantril Life Ladder question:

> ‚ÄúPlease imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?‚Äù

:::{.panel-tabset} 

## üî¢ Table

**Average self-reported life satisfaction** ‚Äì Cantril Ladder score (0=worst; 10=best)

```{r}
# In this tab, you will create a table similar to the one on the Our World in Data page.
# The table should have the following columns:
# Country, `2011`, `2023`, Absolute change, and Relative change.

# You should:
cantril_cols <- cantril %>%
                rename(Cantril_ladder_score=`Cantril ladder score`) %>%
  # 1. Use `select` to drop the Code column from the `cantril` data as it is not needed in the table.
                select(-Code) %>%
  # 2. Filter the `cantril` data frame to just the years 2011 and 2023.
                filter(Year == 2011 | Year == 2023) %>%
  # 3. Use the `pivot_wider` function to create the columns for 2011 and 2023.
                pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Cantril_ladder_score, names_prefix ="CLScore_") %>%
  # 4. Use the `mutate` function to calculate the Absolute change and Relative change.
                mutate(Absolute_Change = CLScore_2023 - CLScore_2011,
                       Relative_Change = Absolute_Change / CLScore_2023) %>%
  # 5. Also with `mutate`, you should round your numbers to appropriate decimal places.
                mutate(Absolute_Change=round(Absolute_Change, digits=2),
  # 6. Then use scales::percent to format the Relative change as a percentage.
                       Relative_Change_pct=percent(round(Relative_Change, digits=2), accuracy=0.01)) 


# 7. Use the `reactable` function to create and output the table. 
cantril_reactbl <-  cantril_cols %>%
                    select(Country, CLScore_2011, CLScore_2023, Absolute_Change, Relative_Change_pct) %>%
                    reactable()
cantril_reactbl
# unique(cantril_cols$Year)               
```


## üåé Map

The map plots the average answer that survey respondents provided to this question in different countries. As with the steps of the ladder, values in the map range from 0 to 10.

```{r}
# This code is already done for you. You don't need to change anything here. If you change any of the column names, or something else with the data, you may need to adjust the code below.
# Create choropleth map
cantril %>%
    mutate(`Cantril ladder score` = round(`Cantril ladder score`, 2)) %>%
    plotly::plot_geo(width = 940) %>%
    add_trace(
        z = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
        color = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
        locations = ~Code,
        text = ~Country,
        frame = ~Year, colors = "YlGn"
    ) %>%
    colorbar(
        title = "Ladder Score",
        limits = c(min(cantril$`Cantril ladder score`), max(cantril$`Cantril ladder score`)),
        tickvals = seq(0, 10, by = 2),
        ticktext = seq(0, 10, by = 2)
    )
```


## üìà Simple Chart

```{r}
# In this tab, create a simple line chart of the Cantril score over time for a few countries,
# similar to the one on the Our World in Data page.
# Note that your chart will not have the ability to filter countries like the one on the Our World in Data page.

# You should:
#unique(cantril$Country)
simple_linechart <- cantril %>% 
  # 1. Filter the cantril data to just 4 to 8 countries you want to highlight
                  filter(Country %in% c("Argentina","Austria","Belgium","Bolivia","Brazil",
                        "Canada","Chile","Denmark","Finland", "Germany","Mexico")) %>%
  # 2. Use ggplot to create a line chart of the Cantril score over time, with different colors for each country
                  ggplot(aes( x=Year, y=`Cantril ladder score`, col= Country)) + 
  # 3. Use geom_line to create the lines
                  geom_line() + 
  # 4. Use scale_y_continuous to set the y-axis limits to 0 and 10.
                  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) +
  # 5. Use labs to create neat labels for the chart
  labs(title="Line chart of the Cantril score over time", x="Year", y="Cantril ladder score") +
  # 6. Use theme_minimal to set the theme.
                  theme_minimal() 
#simple_linechart
# 7. Finally, use ggplotly to convert the ggplot chart to a plotly chart
  ggplotly(simple_linechart)
# (When you're done with this section, don't forget to add tabsets, as mentioned in the instructions.)
```


## üìà Advanced Chart

One problem with the simple chart on the previous tab is that the countries are fixed. It would be better if the user could select the countries they want to see. This is not possible with `plotly` alone, but with the `crosstalk` package and some custom JavaScript, we can achieve this, as demonstrated below.

This is simply a demonstration for you, you do not need to work on this for your assignment. You may want to come back to this when you need such functionality in your own projects.

For more information on how we achieved this, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67058016/how-to-set-default-values-in-filter-select-in-crosstalk-in-r-plotly).


```{r}
pacman::p_load(crosstalk, plotly)

# Crosstalk shared data object
# This allows the filter to interact with the plot
shared_cantril_data <- highlight_key(cantril)

cantril_plotly <- plot_ly(
    shared_cantril_data,
    x = ~Year,
    y = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
    color = ~Country,
    type = "scatter",
    mode = "lines+markers"
) %>%
    layout(yaxis = list(range = c(0, 10)))


country_filter <- filter_select(
    "country_filter",
    "Select a country to examine",
    shared_cantril_data,
    ~Country,
    multiple = TRUE
)

# Output the filter and the plot
bscols(
    list(country_filter, cantril_plotly)
)

# Note that the default countries will only be set when you knit the document.
# Because it relies on the javascript snippet below, which is not rendered in the quarto preview.
```

<!-- CUSTOM JAVASCRIPT TO SET DEFAULT VALUES IN THE FILTER: -->
<script>
function filter_default() {
  var default_countries = ["Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Colombia", "Bhutan", "Mexico"]; // Set default countries here
  document.getElementById("country_filter").getElementsByClassName("selectized")[0].selectize.setValue(default_countries, false);
}
window.onload = filter_default;
</script>


## üî¢ Table with top 10 and 10 bottom countries by happiness score in 2023

The table following listed corresponds to the 10 highest and lowest countries on happiness score from 2011 to 2023.

```{r}
# OPTIONAL CHALLENGE SECTION:

# Add a final tab with a single figure that shows the top 10 and bottom 10 countries by happiness score in 2023. Remember to add a ## header and include it in the tabsets
cantril_top_10 <- cantril_cols %>%
  filter(!is.na(CLScore_2023) & !is.na(CLScore_2011)) %>%
  arrange(-CLScore_2023) %>%
  head(10) 

cantril_low_10 <- cantril_cols %>%
  filter(!is.na(CLScore_2023) & !is.na(CLScore_2011)) %>%
  arrange(-CLScore_2023) %>%
  tail(10)

cantril_toplow_10 <- rbind(cantril_top_10, cantril_low_10) 

cantril_toplow_10_reactbl <- cantril_toplow_10 %>%
                            select(-Relative_Change) %>%
                            reactable()
cantril_toplow_10_reactbl
```
## üìà Chart of Top and Bottom 10 Countries by Happiness Score

The linechart shown below corresponds to the 10 highest and lowest countries on happiness score from 2011 to 2023 and it is based on the table from the preceding tab. We can see the gap between the top 10 countries (Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Australia) which scored highest and the bottom 10 countries (Comoros, Yemen, Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Lebanon and Afghanistan), which scored lowest values on the Cantril ladder score over time. 

```{r}
toplow_10_countries <- unique(cantril_toplow_10$Country)

toplow_10_linechart <- cantril %>% 
  # 1. Filter the cantril data to just 4 to 8 countries you want to highlight
                  filter(Country %in% toplow_10_countries) %>%
  # Specifying the variabe Country as an ordered factor, in order to keep the values
                  mutate(Country=factor(Country, levels=c("Finland","Denmark","Iceland","Sweden","Israel",
                                                          "Netherlands","Norway","Luxembourg","Switzerland","Australia",
                                                          "Comoros","Yemen","Zambia","Malawi","Botswana",
                                                          "Zimbabwe","Democratic Republic of Congo","Sierra Leone",
                                                          "Lebanon","Afghanistan"), ordered=TRUE)) %>%
  # 2. Use ggplot to create a line chart of the Cantril score over time, with different colors for each country
                  ggplot(aes( x=Year, y=`Cantril ladder score`, col= Country)) + 
  # 3. Use geom_line to create the lines
                  geom_line() + 
  # 4. Use scale_y_continuous to set the y-axis limits to 0 and 10.
                  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) +
  # 5. Use labs to create neat labels for the chart
  labs(title="Line chart of the Cantril score from 2011 to 2023", x="Year", y="Cantril ladder score") +
  # 6. Use theme_minimal to set the theme.
                  theme_minimal() 
#simple_linechart
# 7. Finally, use ggplotly to convert the ggplot chart to a plotly chart
  ggplotly(toplow_10_linechart)
  
```  
## üìà Lollipop Plot of Top 10 and Bottom 10 Countries by Relative Change in Happiness Score

Alternatively, we can take a look on the lollipop chart shown below, where the relative change on happiness score is displayed for the 10 countries which scored either highest or lowest  from 2011 to 2023. We can also see here the gap (although less noticeable) between the top 10 countries (Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Australia) which scored highest and the bottom 10 countries (Comoros, Yemen, Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Lebanon and Afghanistan), which scored lowest values on the Cantril ladder score over time. 
```{r}
toplow_10_chart <- cantril_toplow_10 %>% 
                  mutate(Relative_Change=(100*round(Relative_Change,digits=2)),
                         Country=factor(Country, levels=c("Finland","Denmark","Iceland","Sweden","Israel",
                                                          "Netherlands","Norway","Luxembourg","Switzerland","Australia",
                                                          "Comoros","Yemen","Zambia","Malawi","Botswana",
                                                          "Zimbabwe","Democratic Republic of Congo","Sierra Leone",
                                                          "Lebanon","Afghanistan"), ordered=TRUE)) %>%
  # 2. Use ggplot to create a lollipop chart of the relative change in Cantril score over time, with different colors for each country
                  ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = Relative_Change)) +
                  geom_segment(aes(x = Country, xend = Country, y = 0, yend = Relative_Change),
                               color = "gray71", lwd = 1) +
                  geom_point(col = "gray71") +
                  #geom_point(size = 7.5, pch = 21, bg = 4, col = "gray41") +
                  geom_text(aes(label = Relative_Change_pct), nudge_y = 0.7, color = "black", size = 3) +
  # 4. Use scale_y_continuous to set the y-axis limits to -150 and 25.
                  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-150.00, 25.00)) +
  # 5. Use labs to create neat labels for the chart
  labs(x="Country", y="Relative Change (%) from 2011 to 2023") +
  # 6. Use theme_minimal to set the theme.
                  theme_minimal()  +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,
                                   vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
# 7. Finally, use ggplotly to convert the ggplot chart to a plotly chart
  ggplotly(toplow_10_chart)
